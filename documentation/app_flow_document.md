# App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
When a new user wants to manage the Taman Kehati dashboard, they begin by navigating to the public URL and clicking the "Admin Login" link in the header. This brings them to the sign-in page at `/login`, where they enter their email address and password. If they have forgotten their password, they click the "Forgot Password" link to open a reset email form. They type their registered email and receive a password recovery link, which directs them to a secure page to set a new password. Once they create a new password, they return to the sign-in page and log in normally. The app does not provide a self-serve sign-up for admins; new admin accounts are created by a Super Admin within the Admin Settings area. After login, users can choose to sign out by clicking their profile avatar in the top right and selecting "Sign Out," which returns them to the public homepage.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
After a successful login, the user arrives on the Dashboard overview page. At the top of the screen sits a persistent header showing the Taman Kehati logo, a search input, and the user avatar. On the left side is the sidebar containing links to each management section: Dashboard Home, Flora, Fauna, and Berita. The central area of the page displays summary cards that show key statistics such as total flora entries and pending approval counts. Below the cards, an interactive chart presents national and regional trends. Users click any sidebar link to move from the Dashboard overview to specific content modules. The layout remains fixed, and only the main content region changes when the user navigates between pages.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
When the user clicks the "Flora" link in the sidebar, they are taken to the Flora management page. Here, a data table lists all flora records with columns for name, status, and region. Above the table sits a search bar and status filter dropdown. Users type in the search bar to filter by scientific or local names, or they choose a status filter to show only Approved, Pending, or Rejected items. Clicking on a table row or the "View" button opens a detail page for that flora item. On the detail page, the user sees full information, including images and the description. If the user has the right role, they see action buttons to edit, approve, or reject the entry. To create new flora content, the user clicks the "Add New" button above the table, which opens a form page. In the form, they upload images, fill out text fields, choose a region code, and click "Save" to submit. The app validates each field and shows inline error messages if any input is invalid. After a successful save, the user returns to the list view with a success banner displayed.

The Fauna and Berita sections follow the same navigation pattern. Each has its own data table, filters, and detail pages. Regional Admin users only see items associated with their assigned region, while Super Admin users see all items. When Super Admins manage workflows, they click "Approve" or "Reject" on pending items. Rejecting an item opens a modal where they enter a rejection reason. After confirming, the item status changes to Rejected, and the list refreshes.

On the public side, visitors land on the homepage at `/`, which displays a hero banner and links to explore Taman, Flora, and Fauna. Clicking "Taman" navigates to `/taman`, showing an interactive map of all regions with markers for points of interest. Users zoom and pan the map, and clicking a marker opens a popup with basic information and a link to a detailed view page. The Flora page at `/flora` and the Fauna page at `/fauna` present searchable lists of public flora and fauna entries. Users type keywords to filter the list and click an item to see its details, including images, descriptions, and habitat information. On any public page, a chat icon floats in the bottom right. When clicked, the chatbot panel slides up. Users type a question into the chat input, and the app sends their message to the `/api/public/chat` endpoint, then displays the AI’s response in the chat panel.

## Settings and Account Management
From the dashboard header, users click their profile avatar to open the account menu. There they select "Account Settings," which takes them to a page showing personal information and preferences. Users update their name, email, and password by filling out forms and clicking "Update". If regional assignments need to change, Super Admin users see a dropdown for region codes; Regional Admins do not see this option. Notification preferences appear as toggle switches for email alerts related to content submissions and approval status. After saving changes, the user sees a confirmation message and can click "Back to Dashboard" to return to the main flow.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
If users enter incorrect credentials on the login page, the form displays a red error message above the fields telling them the email or password is invalid. If they lose their network connection while working in the dashboard, a banner appears at the top warning of connectivity issues, and any unsaved changes remain in the form until the connection restores. When trying to access a page they do not have permission for, such as a Regional Admin attempting to view another region’s items or a non-logged-in visitor hitting `/dashboard`, they are redirected to a 403 Forbidden page explaining they lack access and offering a link back to an allowed area. Global 404 pages handle unknown routes by showing a friendly message and links back to the home or dashboard landing pages.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
From start to finish, the user journey begins at the public homepage, where visitors can explore Taman information and use the chatbot for quick answers. Admin users arrive at the sign-in page to authenticate, then access the dashboard overview with summary cards and interactive charts. They navigate through Flora, Fauna, and Berita management pages to create, edit, and release content. Role-based controls ensure Super Admins oversee all regions and handle approvals, while Regional Admins manage only their assigned areas. Account settings let admins update their details and notification preferences at any time. Throughout the app, clear error messages and recovery paths guide users back to a normal flow whenever they face issues. This complete journey supports both public engagement with Taman Kehati and efficient content management in the Admin CMS.
